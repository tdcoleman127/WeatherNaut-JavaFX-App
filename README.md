# WeatherNaut-JavaFX-App

Over the month of March 2025, I completed Project 2 in my CS 342 class. My app is called “WeatherNaut” and includes 6 scenes to help users see the daily and 3-day weather forecasts. I adopted an interface similar to a cellphone or small tablet, but at a size easy for editing purposes.

In the future, I would improve my app by adding more icons for specific weather patterns and transitions between scenes (hopefully with custom backgrounds).
